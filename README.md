# CPSC 411 Milestone 3 Skeleton
This branch provides the skeleton for CPSC 411 Milestone 3.

When submitting, you should ensure the name of the `compiler.rkt` file and the
provides from that file are the same as in this commit.
You may change the code base in any other way, including moving code to other
files, as long as `compiler.rkt` reprovides the appropriate functions.
You can check this is the case by running `raco test interface-test.rkt`.

To submit, make sure you most recent work is merged into this branch and this
branch is pushed.

For versions of the skeletons from prior versions of the course, see the tags.
